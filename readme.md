I have created this project which uses the AreaCalculator jar. The AreaCalculator.jar 
contains classes for different shapes and a Shape Interface. The code for that can 
be found in the jar file. In eclipse I have attached the jar file in the java build 
path of the project. We can also execute this project through a command line using 
the below mentioned commands:
javac -cp <path of the jar> TestClass.java
java -cp <path of the jar> testAreaCalculator.TestClass
Note: For now I have kept the jar in the root directory of the project.
